This project is built to output my learning from Kaggle using git branching and merging between each course and project to be familiar with Git Workflow. conda env is used for this project to facilitate dependency management.The project is structured in a simple manner to get started before getting further to work with modules and __init__.py or more complicate config files in the further projects.
